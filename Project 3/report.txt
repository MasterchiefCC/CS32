thought I notice the data was loaded from the bottom of the map, which means the (0,0) crood is at the bottom left, it is extremely inlogic to set up to Y+1 and down to Y-1



Class Actor

	virtual void doSomething() = 0;//every actor to do something, because actor don't have to do something, it is pure virtual function
	virtual ~Actor() {};//because lots of class is based on Actor, so destructor has to be virtual
	int setHP(int value);//set Hit point
	StudentWorld* getworld();//get the pointer to student world
	int getHP() const;//get the value of Hit Point
	int setSleep(int sleep);//set Actor to sleep
	int getSleep() const;//get the value that how many ticks should be sleep
	int ranDirection();//set a random direction
	Actor* gettrapped();//determine which water pool trap actor
	Actor*setTrapped(Actor*temp);//set which water pool trap actor
	bool isDead()//determine whether or not the actor dead
	bool eat()//Et food
	virtual void setbite() {};//set bite for ant class, so it has to be virtual
	virtual int getID() { return 0; }//get coloney number for ant, so it has to be virtual, becuase some class don't have colony number

Class ants
	virtual void doSomething();//do something
	void move();//ant's move
	int StringtoInt(string temp);//convert a string to Int
	void Eeat();// ant's eat
	void setbite() //ant being bite by other insect
	void bite();//ant 's bite
	void pickup();//pickup food food class
	Compiler::Condition covertoCondition(string ope);//covert a string to enum condition
	bool readIF(Compiler::Command cmd);//read if statement
	void emit();//emit Pheromone
	virtual int getID() {//get colony number

class Pheromone
	virtual void doSomething();//do something
	virtual  int getID() {//get colony number

class Pebble
	virtual void doSomething();//Althought don't need to dosomething but in based class it is a pure virtual function

class Food
	virtual void doSomething();//Althought don't need to dosomething but in based class it is a pure virtual function

class Anthill
	virtual void doSomething();//dosomething

class Baby_Grasshopper
	void move();//move for bady_Grasshopper and adult_Grasshopper
	virtual void doSomething();//dosomething

class Adult_Grasshopper
	virtual void doSomething();//doSomething
	bool bite();//bite for Grasshopper
	bool jump();//jump
class Water
	virtual void doSomething()//doSomething
class StudentWorld
	virtual int init();//init		virtual because it is come from it based class throught it don't need to, it can increase readibitily of code
	virtual int move();//call all actor to move		virtual because it is come from it based class throught it don't need to, it can increase readibitily of code
	virtual void cleanUp();//cleanup		virtual because it is come from it based class throught it don't need to, it can increase readibitily of code
	bool addActor(Actor*p,char type);//add a actor to data struct
	nlist findObj(char type);//find the linked list for certain obj
	bool DoDo(char type);//do something for all subject
	char getmap(int x, int y);//get the map for pebble etc
	char getfmap(int x, int y);//get the food map
	void setfmap(int x, int y);//set the food map
	void setnoAnt(int index, int n) {//set the ant number
		noAnt[index] = n;
	}
	bool hill2000(int index);//whether or not the hill has 2000 hit points
	int getnoAnt(int index) {//get number of a certain colony of ant
		return noAnt[index];
	}
	void del();//delete dead obj
	void setFood(nlist temp);//set the food map
//other part in student dont need to implent virtual, because it don't has derived class

I haven't implentment poision trggied to poision while object is moving
I haven't impletment water pool trggied to trapped object while object is moving
for those part, I think it is extrememly stupid to

I am not sure the bite of my program
the spec doesn't specify that;
there is not precedence of insect to bite
for example: In a linked list, there is a insect the first insect in (1,1) is at the first poisition of linked list
ther is a another insect in (1, 3) is in the second position of the linked list
If the insect in (1,1), it move from (1,1) to (1,3)
when call the second insect to dosomething, should the second insect bite the first one?
In my program I set the second insect going to bite the first one

simialar with bite part
should anthill eat food after the all object moved or it should eat after ant drop?
In my program, if a ant drop in 1 round, my anthill going to eat it in the next round

simialar with born ant part
should birth come before than ant move or opposite?
My program give birth of all ant then ant going to move

simialar with baby grasshopper to adult grasshopper part
after baby grasshoppper transfer to adult grasshopper should it move?
my one wonldn't move

for every class in the test case, I add breakpoint in every if statement to check whether or not the program going to go through this breakpoint.
Because there are 2000 simulation go through this program, if I implentate it correctly, it defintely going to that breakpoint.
