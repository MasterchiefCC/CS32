MyMap:
associate(): N is the item number
O(logN)
find(): N is the item number
O(logN)
AttractionMapper: 
init(): N total street segments in the input mapping data, and A total attractions
O(N+A*log(A))
getGeoCoord():
O(log(A))
SegmentMapper: 
because I didn't overload the operator, In my SegmentMapper, there are a map contain X croodinate coresponsing the index for the vector which contain the Y coordinates which have same X coordinate.a vector which contain pointer to a map coresponsing to Y shared the same X coordinate the Y coordinate will coresponsing to a vector contain StreetSegment share the same coordinate.
N is the total street segments
init(): (NlogN)
N reprent the total different X coordinate, Y is the the number of S coordinate coreponse to a particle X
getSegments():(logN+logS)
Navigator: push a new item to heap, find a coord cost logN^2, and traverse closed table and open table and to traverse all the points on map cost N^2
navigate() :NlogN
